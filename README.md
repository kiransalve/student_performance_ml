# Pipeline 

## Traning Pipeline

-> Getting data

-> Train Test Split

-> Exploratory data analysis

-> Feature Transformation

-> Model Training, Evalution, Monitoring

Components - 

1. Data Source - MySQL, MongoDB - Collecting data from various sources to one point

2. Data Ingestion - We read data from above Data Source and do Train Test Split

3. Data Transformation - EDA and Feature Engineering

4. Model Trainer - Multiple model - will choose best one

5. Model Monitoring - (Evidently AI) CI CD Pipelines using Github Actions

6. Model Deployment 


## Prediction Pipeline 

We give input and this give output
